# Embedify Discord Bot

## What does this bot do? 

There are too many damn services now blocking embeds, and so it's a quick bot to fix them with publicly available embed proxies. 

## How do I add?
To add to your channel: [https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1197310892866539671&permissions=274877925440&scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1197310892866539671&permissions=274877925440&scope=bot).

## Self-hosting

If you'd like to self-host, simply provide a `DISCORD_TOKEN` in a `.env` file (sample included). Review the Discord documentation for information on how to get started with building a Discord Bot. Otherwise, feel free to use the self-hosted version. 

## Development

Feel free to submit PRs if you like, such as if you find that a given embed stops working for one reason or another, or you'd like to add another domain.
